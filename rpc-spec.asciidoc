The missing specification.

== No maintenance intended

This document has been adopted by the Thrift project at https://github.com/apache/thrift/tree/master/doc/specs and is maintained there by the Thrift community. This copy will not receive any further updates.

== Introduction

Thrift is a RPC mechanism that easily blends in with your code. It has a wonderful transport protocol that stays
backward and forward compatible without the security pitfalls brought by
https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/serialization-must-die-act-1-kryo[seriapalooza].

This document specifies the so far undocumented thrift RPC message exchange and the wire encoding of those messages in
the binary protocol and the more modern compact protocol. Then the binary protocol and compact protocol are
compared. Finally it describes the framed vs. unframed transport.

For background on Thrift see the https://thrift.apache.org/static/files/thrift-20070401.pdf[Thrift white paper (pdf)].

This document is for Thrift implementers. Thrift users should read the https://thrift.apache.org/[thrift documentation]
and the https://diwakergupta.github.io/thrift-missing-guide/[missing thrift guide].

The information here is based on research in the Java implementation in the Apache thrift library (version 0.9.1
and 0.9.3) and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-110[THRIFT-110 A more compact format].
Other implementation however, should behave the same.

== BNF notation used in this document

The following BNF notation is used:

* a plus `+` appended to an item represents repetition; the item is repeated 1 or more times
* a star `*` appended to an item represents optional repetition; the item is repeated 0 or more times
* a pipe `|` between items represents choice, the first matching item is selected
* parenthesis `(` and `)` are used for grouping multiple items
